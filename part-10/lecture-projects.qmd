# [Quick Recap of the last Lecture]{.flow} {.title} 

# [General]{.flow} {.title}

## Congratulations

:partying_face: You've learned your first steps to program with Python! :tada:

## Structure

- Over the upcoming weeks you [will work on a project]{.highlight}
- You will present it in the last week of this course
- You can work in groups of up to 3 people
- You can choose from a wide range of project ideas
- Or you can **propose your own idea!**

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
You have enough time to discuss different ideas in your group today. From my experience, it is a good idea to choose a project that you are **really interested in**.
:::

## Presentation

- Each group has **15 minutes** with 5 additional minutes for questions
- Introduce your idea and the development cycle
- Provide code examples and/or visualizations
- Comment on [challenges and what you've learned]{.highlight}

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Your project does not have to be perfect! To pass, you simply have to show that you tried your best. Try, fail potentially and learn - [that's the best way to improve your coding skills.]{.highlight}
