- Prequisite for course *Management Science* (Prof. Goel)
- Try actively participating in this course 
- You will find it much (!) easier to follow Prof. Goel's course
- Materials will be provided in the KLU portal
- Slides are hosted at [python.beyondsimulations.com](https://python.beyondsimulations.com)

## Teaching

- **Lecture:** Presentation of tools and concepts, based on small examples and code snippets
- **Tutorial:** Hands-on examples to be solved in groups
- **Difficulty:** Difficult at first, but gradually easier

## Passing the course 

- Pass/fail course
- 75% attendance required for passing the course
- 2 assignments and 1 little project
- You will be given programming exercises to solve with Python
- You can group up (3 students) and work together 
- Each student group submits one solution together

## Solution

- Provide a code solution to the problem (`.py` files)
- Code files need to be executable
- Detailed explanations of your code should be provided
- Use comments or docstrings in your code
- Provide a general (verbal) introduction to each problem

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
I'd encourage you to start and submit your solution early
:::

## Difficulty of the course

- We'll cover the basics of programming (in Python) at first
- This is similar to learning a **new foreign language**
- First, you have to get used to the language and learn first words
- **Later**, you'll be able to apply the language and see results
- Similar to learning a language: *Practice, practice, practice!*

## What to expect
- Some **investment** in the beginning to see the **return** later
- You can ask questions and get support anytime 
- After completing the course, you will be able to read code 
- **and** write your own program using Python
- **That's quite something!**

## Goals of the course

- Essential concepts and tools of modern programming
- Automated solutions for recurrent tasks
- Algorithm-based solutions of complex problems
- **Usage of AI** in a specific context

## Python as language

- **Origins**: Conceived in late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language
- **Simple Syntax**: Python’s syntax is straightforward and easy to learn
- **Versatility**: Used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more
- **Community Support**: A large community of users and extensive documentation

## Help from AI

- You are allowed to use AI (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, LLama3 ...)
- These new tools are really powerful for learning Python!
- They can help you a lot to get started with programming

. . .

:::{.callout-warning}
But you should *not* simply use them to *replace* your learning.

# [How to learn programming]{.flow .r-fit-text} {.title}

## My recommendation

1. **Be present**: Attend the lecture and participate
2. **Put in some work**: Repeat lecture notes and try to understand the examples yourself
3. **Do coding**: Run code examples on your own, play around, *google*/*find help*, modify, and solve problems on your own

. . .

:::{.callout-note}
Great resources to start are books and small challenges. In my opinion both are much more helpful than watching videos! You can find a list of book recommendations at the end of the lecture. Small challenges to solve can for example be found on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
:::

## Don't give up!

- Programming is **problem solving**, don't get **frustrated** too easily at the start!
- Learn something new: Expect to **stretch** your comfort zone

## Learning path
- The learning path can be quite steep!
- **First of all help each other!**
- Try to find help in lecture materials and books, the Python documentation, and online (e.g. Google, ChatGPT, StackOverflow, ...)
- In case you get frustrated with programming, read the following [helpful blog post about the challenges on medium.com](https://medium.com/sololearn/why-learning-to-code-is-soooo-hard-3c2372e9d12c)

# [Setting up Python]{.flow .r-fit-text} {.title}

## Install Python

- You could download it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- **But I would recommend we start by using [Thonny](https://thonny.org/)**
- It is an open source IDE that runs on Windows, Linux and Mac
- It comes with a built-in Python interpreter and package management!

## What is an IDE?

- An **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) is an application 
- It allows you to write, run and debug code scripts
- Thonny is an IDE specifically for Python and aimed at beginners
- It does not use the latest Python and has the most features 
- **But it is easy to use as beginner!**
- Other IDEs include for example [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from JetBrains or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) from Microsoft

## Thonny
- Download and install Thonny from the [website](https://thonny.org/)
- Start the programm and you should see the following window:

![First start of Thonny](images/thonny_start.png){#fig-startThonny}


## Python on iPads
- Although you can run Python scripts from on your iPad, it is not recommended for the course
- Nonetheless, if you have no other option, you could use [Pythonista](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097)
- It works locally on your iPad and can run most Python scripts

. . .

::: {.callout-caution}
Not all packages generally available in Python are be available in Pythonista, thus you might need a computer to solve certain problems.
:::

## First start of Pythonista
![First start of Pythonista](images/start_pythonista.png){#fig-startPythonista}

# [Your first code]{.flow .r-fit-text} {.title}

## Hello, World!
Create a directory for the course and create a new file called `hello_world.py` with the following code and save it:

```{python}
#| eval: false

# This is a comment in Python
print("Hello, World!")
```


. . .

Run the code with the green 'run' button at the top or by going to the line and pressing [Shift+Enter].{red}:

. . .

```{python}
#| eval: true

# This is a comment in Python
print("Hello, World!")
```
. . .

::: {.callout-note}
"Hello world" is a classic example to start with. It is often used as a test to check if your computer is working properly and that you have installed the necessary software.
:::

## Hello, World!
[Your Task]{.red}: Change the code in your `hello_world.py` file. Assign the string `"Hello, World!"` to a variable called `message` and print the variable.

. . .

- Use the equals sign (=)
- Variable name goes on the left
- Value to be assigned goes on the right

. . .

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Here we assign the string "Hello, World!" to variable message and print it
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)
```

## Hello, World!
We can also mix `"` and `'` in a string. We just have to be consistent:

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| output-location: fragment

# This code works
message = 'I shout "Hello, World!"'
print(message)
```

. . .

\

```{python}
#| eval: true
#| error: true
#| output-location: fragment

# This code does not
message = 'I shout 'Hello, World!""
print(message)
```

# [Program]{.flow .r-fit-text} {.title}

## What is a program?

- A sequence of instructions telling a computer what to do
- Written in a programming language the computer can understand
- Basic operations in virtually any language: 
    - **Input**: Get data from keyboard, file, network, sensors, etc.
    - **Output**: Display data on screen, save to file, send over network, etc.
    - **Processing**: Perform calculations, analyze data, make decisions, find patterns, etc.
    
## What is a program?

- Key concepts in virtually any language:
    - **Variables**: Store and manipulate data 
    - **Conditional execution**: Check conditions and execute accordingly
    - **Loops**: Perform actions repeatedly, often with variations
    - **Functions**: Group instructions for reusability

> **Programming**: Process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller substasks until the subtask is simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions (Downey, 2015, P. 2)

## Hello again, World!

Let's go back to our first program:

```{python}
#| eval: false

# Our first program
message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)
```

. . .

- **Comment**: In the first line we define a comment with `#`
    - It is not executed but used to explain what code does
- **Variable**: In the second line we define a variable `message`
    - It points to a string that contains the text "Hello, World!"
- **Function**: In the third line we call a function `print`
    - It prints out whatever is stored in `message`

## Hello again, World!
- [Already confused?]{.red} 
- Don't worry about it for now!
- We'll learn more about variables and functions later

# [Python's Syntax]{.flow .r-fit-text} {.title}

## The Zen of Python

- Python's name originally comes from Monty Python
- Style is based on a philosophy called [Zen of Python]{.red}: A collection of 19 statements intended to communicate general principles
```{python}
#| eval: false

# Try this code in Python to see the Zen of Python
import this
```

## Values and Types

- **Value**: Fundamental thing that a program manipulates
    - In Python, values are either numbers or strings
- **Type**: Type of a value 
    - Determines what operations can be performed on it
    - `type()` is a function that returns the type of a value
    - It takes one argument (a value) and returns its type as string

## Values and Types
Back to our example of "Hello, World!"
```{python}
#| eval: true
#| code-line-numbers: 1-2|4-5|7-8
#| output-location: fragment

# We define the variable message and assign it the value "Hello, World!"
message = "Hello, World!"

# We save its type in another variable called message_type
message_type = type(message)

# We print the value of our new variable
print(f"{message} is a {message_type}")

```

. . .

\
**Result**: "Hello, World" is a string or in short 'str'.

. . .

[But what about the f"?]{.red}

## Formated Strings

- **f-strings** are strings that start with `f`
- They contain expressions ([here variables]{.red}) in braces
- They are evaluated at run time and inserted into the string
- This is called **interpolation**

. . .

::: {.callout-note}
In older code bases, f strings were not available. Here, interpolation could be done as shown below with `print()` and `.format()`. But this method is less concise and arguably less readable.
:::

```{python}
#| eval: true
print("{} is a {}".format(message, message_type))
```

## Integer

## Float

## Boolean
