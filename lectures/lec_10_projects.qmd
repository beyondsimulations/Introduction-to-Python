## Structure

- Over the upcoming weeks you [will work on a project]{.highlight}
- You will present it in the last week of this course
- You can work in groups of up to 3 people
- Choose from a list of ideas or **propose your own idea!**

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
You have enough time to discuss different ideas in your group today. From my experience, it is a good idea to choose a project that you are **really interested in**.
:::

## Presentation

- Each group has **10 minutes** for the presentation with 5 additional minutes for questions
- Introduce your idea and the development cycle
- Provide code examples and/or visualizations
- Comment on [challenges and what you've learned]{.highlight}

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Your project does not have to be perfect! To pass, you simply have to show that you tried your best. Try, fail potentially and learn. [That's the best way to improve your coding skills.]{.highlight}

. . .

**Bonus:** OCR for screen reading, computer vision for UI detection

## Idea 8: Your  Idea?
- Have an idea that is not on the list?
- Something that potentially would help you personally?
- [Make it ambitious and do it!]{.highlight} 
- Consider: deployment, testing, user interface
- Combine multiple technologies and concepts
- **Let me know and we can discuss scope and feasibility!**

# [Help over the upcoming weeks]{.flow} {.title}

## Ask Questions

- In case you need help, you can always ask me!
- The next lectures are there to work on your project
- You can also write me an email at [vlcek@beyondsimulations.com](mailto:vlcek@beyondsimulations.com)

:::{.callout-tip}
I am always happy to help you with your project. There are no stupid questions!
:::

## Use of AI Tools

- [Strongly encouraged]{.highlight} to use AI tools for your project!
- Remember: AI accelerates development, but [understanding is essential]{.highlight}
- Use AI to learn patterns, debug issues, and explore solutions

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Try multiple AI tools to find what works best for your workflow. Claude Code, Zed, Copilot, Cursor, OpenCode and LM Studio are all excellent choices!
:::

## Agentic Coding

[Agentic coding]{.highlight} means AI agents work autonomously on tasks

. . .

**How it works:**

- You describe what you want to achieve
- The AI agent plans and executes multiple steps
- It can run tests, fix errors, and iterate independently
- You review and guide the overall direction

. . .

::: callout-tip
**Best for:** Complex refactoring, adding test suites, documentation generation, multi-step implementations
:::

## Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/) is an AI coding assistant by Anthropic

. . .

**Key Features:**

- Understands entire codebases, not just single files
- Can edit multiple files simultaneously
- Explains complex code patterns clearly
- Helps with debugging and refactoring

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Great for: Understanding project structure, implementing features across multiple files, learning best practices
:::


## Alternative AI Coding Tools

Beyond Claude Code, many tools are available:

. . .

**Popular Options:**

- **Open Code**: Open Source alternative to Claude Code
- **Cursor**: AI-first code editor based on VS Code
- **Zed**: Lightweight editor with Claude & ChatGPT integration

. . .

Each tool has strengths, experiment to find your preference!

. . .

::: callout-tip
Personally, I work with Zed, Claude Code and OpenCode with Mistral.
:::

## LM Studio: Local AI for Privacy

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) runs AI models entirely on your computer

. . .

**Benefits:**

- Complete privacy - your code never leaves your machine
- No API costs or rate limits
- Works offline with full control over model selection

. . .

:::{.callout-tip}
Ideal if you're working with sensitive data or want to learn without internet dependency. Requires a decent GPU for best performance.

# [Discuss your ideas!]{.flow} {.title}

# [How to continue?]{.flow} {.title}

## How to continue after the presentations?

- The best way to continue learning is to [keep programming in the future]{.highlight}
- Potentially, you will continue to do so during your studies
- Coding in your Thesis is a another great way to improve
- Try to find a way to apply programming in your work
- **There are many interesting topics to explore!**

## Advent of Code

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun way to keep programming
- Here you can solve programming puzzles during Advent
- It is completely free and ad-free and starts at 01.12.
