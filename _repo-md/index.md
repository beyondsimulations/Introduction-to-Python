# Objectives

This module introduces **programming with python**. Python is a modern and powerful programming language that is widely used in industry and academic projects. Students will learn how to find a code-based solution to basic and complex problems. The course is based on many examples that illustrate how to tackle a potentially complex issue as well as how to implement a solution.

# Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students ...

-   can implement solutions to complex problems in python
-   know basic concepts of programming and algorithms such as loops, functions
-   can apply basic data manipulation and visualization
-   will be able to read and write code
-   will have experience working with python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
-   will know how to collaborate in a small team to find solutions for problems at hand

Please note that this course is **specifically designed for business students**. That is, it is **not required to have any prior knowledge or experience in programming** to attend this course. The teaching format will make it possible to account for different levels of programming skills such that every student can take the most out of the course.

# Course Structure

The course is based on a hands-on approach with a two-fold structure:

1.  **Lectures**: In the lectures, we will introduce concepts and illustrate them in reproducible examples.
2.  **Hands-on Tutorials**: Students will practically apply the concepts of the lecture in hands-on examples.
3.  **Assignments**: Students will solve programming exercises in groups of up to three students that they will have to hand in.

# Course Blocks

The core content of the course is organized in three blocks:

1.  **Part I**: Introduction to Programming with Python
2.  **Part II**: Data Science with Python
3.  **Part III**: Programming Projects

You can find more information on the course blocks and the corresponding lectures in the [syllabus](general/syllabus.qmd).

# How to see the slides

-   This course is based on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
-   It uses [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) to render the slides
-   You find the slides for each lecture in the corresponding lecture
-   To see the slides, click on `RevealJS` in the top right corner

# Passing the Course

-   75% attendance required for passing the course
-   You will be given two programming assignments and one project to solve with Python
-   You can group up (3 students) and work together
-   Each student group submits one solution together
