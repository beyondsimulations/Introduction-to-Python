# Use a while loop to allow the user to guess
# Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low
# Count the number of guesses and display it when correct

# Hint: Convert the word to a list, shuffle it, and join it back to a string
# Your code here

# List of words to choose from

# TODO: Randomly select a word from the list
# Your code here

# TODO: Scramble the selected word
# Your code here

# TODO: Set up the game loop
# - Print the scrambled word
# - Ask the user for a guess
# - Check if the guess is correct
# - If correct, congratulate and end the game
# - If incorrect, allow more guesses (maybe limit the number of attempts?)
# Your code here

# Run the game
