```{python}
# TODO: Implement a password strength checker
# Use string methods and conditional statements
# Check for:
# - Minimum length of 8 characters
# - At least one uppercase letter
# - At least one lowercase letter
# - At least one digit
# - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
# Return "Weak", "Medium", or "Strong" based on criteria met

# Test your function
#print(check_password_strength("abc123"))
#print(check_password_strength("Str0ngP@ssw0rd"))
```

```{python}

# TODO: Scramble the letters of the word
# Hint: Convert the word to a list, shuffle it, and join it back to a string
# Your code here

# List of words to choose from
words = ["python", "programming", "computer", "algorithm", "database"]

# TODO: Randomly select a word from the list
# Your code here

# TODO: Scramble the selected word
# Your code here

# TODO: Set up the game loop
# - Print the scrambled word
# - Ask the user for a guess
# - Check if the guess is correct
# - If correct, congratulate and end the game
# - If incorrect, allow more guesses (maybe limit the number of attempts?)
# Your code here

# Run the game
