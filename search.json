    "text": "Introduction\nThis is the second of the two assignments for this course. It will be graded as pass/fail and you and your group of up to 3 students will need to submit it before the start of the last lecture. Please hand in one assignment per group via the e-mail address vlcek@beyondsimulations.com.\nIn the assignment, you will practice the concepts you learned in the second part of the course. You will find a lot of information online and you are welcome to use generative AI to help you with the assignment. However, you are not allowed to copy the code from other groups and you have to indicate where and how you used AI to help you. Try to use comments to structure and to explain your code. Furthermore, use descriptive variable names and format your code nicely in order to make it more readable.\n\n\nRedact secret information\nIn this excercise, you will create a program that is able to redact secret information in a text. The program should be able to redact the following: zip codes, names, email addresses and phone numbers. The program should ask the user for a filename and then read the file and redact the secret information. The program should then print the redacted text to the console and write it to a new file called redacted.txt. You can find a file with secret information in the git repository under assignments/secret-text.txt.\n\n# Secret information redactor\n# TODO: Create a program that is able to redact secret information in a text.\n# Your code here\n\n\n\nDice roll simulator\nIn this excercise, you will create a program that is able to simulate dice rolls and visualizes their distribution. The program should ask the user for the number of sides on the dice and the number of dices to roll. Then, the program should simulate the dice rolls 10000 times and visualize the distribution of the dice rolls using a histogram.\n\n# Dice roll simulator\n# TODO: Create a program that is able to simulate a dice roll.\n# Your code here\n\n\n\nRegression analysis\nIn this excercise, you will create a program that performs linear regression on a dataset with housing prices. The dataset can be found in the git repository under assignments/hamburg_housing_prices.csv. The dataset contains the following columns:\n\nPrice: The price of the house in Euros.\nArea: The area of the house in square meters.\nRooms: The number of rooms in the house.\nYear_Built: The year the house was built.\nDistance_to_Center: The distance to the center of Hamburg in kilometers.\n\nYour task is to perform a linear regression analysis on the dataset and to predict the price of a house based on its area, number of rooms, year it was built and its distance to the center of Hamburg. You can use the pandas library to read the dataset and the numpy library to perform the linear regression analysis. After performing the linear regression analysis, use the matplotlib library to visualize the relationship between the price and the other features as well as the predicted prices for a given set of features.\n\n# Regression analysis\n# TODO: Create a program that performs linear regression analysis on the dataset.\n# Your code here",

    "text": "Objectives\nThis module introduces programming with python. Python is a modern and powerful programming language that is widely used in industry and academic projects. Students will learn how to find a code-based solution to basic and complex problems. The course is based on many examples that illustrate how to tackle a potentially complex issue as well as how to implement a solution.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nUpon completion of the course, students …\n\ncan implement solutions to complex problems in python\nknow basic concepts of programming and algorithms such as loops, functions\ncan apply basic data manipulation and visualization\nwill be able to read and write code\nwill have experience working with python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib\nwill know how to collaborate in a small team to find solutions for problems at hand\n\nPlease note that this course is specifically designed for business students. That is, it is not required to have any prior knowledge or experience in programming to attend this course. The teaching format will make it possible to account for different levels of programming skills such that every student can take the most out of the course.\n\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is based on a hands-on approach with a two-fold structure:\n\nLectures: In the lectures, we will introduce concepts and illustrate them in reproducible examples.\nHands-on Tutorials: Students will practically apply the concepts of the lecture in hands-on examples.\nAssignments: Students will solve programming exercises in groups of up to three students that they will have to hand in.\n\n\n\nCourse Blocks\nThe core content of the course is organized in three blocks:\n\nPart I: Introduction to Programming with Python\nPart II: Data Science with Python\nPart III: Programming Projects\n\nYou can find more information on the course blocks and the corresponding lectures in the syllabus.\n\n\nHow to see the slides\n\nThis course is based on Quarto\nIt uses revealjs to render the slides\nYou find the slides for each lecture in the corresponding lecture\nTo see the slides, click on RevealJS in the top right corner\n\n\n\nPassing the Course\n\n75% attendance required for passing the course\nYou will be given two programming assignments and one project to solve with Python\nYou can group up (3 students) and work together\nEach student group submits one solution together\n\n\n\nQuestions\nIf you have any questions regarding the course, please contact me under vlcek@beyondsimulations.com.\n\n\nContributors\nThanks to Phillip Bach whose original course material laid the foundation for this course.",

Don’t worry, I won’t repeat this section again and again.\n\n\nDecoding secret messages with methods\nIn this exercise, we’ll practice string manipulation and slicing. You’ll work with a secret message encoded using various string operations and learn how to apply some new methods like title(), replace() and count(). By following a series of steps, you’ll gradually decode the message. Let’s begin with the encoded message and work through each decoding step:\n\n# Decode a secret message by following a series of instructions.\n# Each instruction requires you to use different operations and methods.\n# The encoded message is:\nsecret_message = \".tnega terces a sa slliks ym sevorpmi erutcel oN\"\n\n# a) TODO: Reverse the string\n# Hint: You can use slicing to reverse a string\n# Your code here\n\n# b) TODO: Remove the period at the end\n# Your code here\n\n# c) TODO: Replace 'No' with 'This'\n# Your code here\n\n# d) TODO: Convert the string to title case\n# -&gt; Capitalize the first letter of each word\n# Your code here\n\n# e) TODO: Add an exclamation mark at the end of the sentence\n# Your code here\n\n# f) TODO: Count how many times the letter 's' appears in the decoded message (upper and lower case)\n# Your code here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUse the help() function to get more information about a method. For example, typing help(str.replace) in the shell will show the documentation for the replace() method. To exit the documentation, press q.\n\n\n\n\nClassifying temperatures\nIn this exercise, we’ll practice using conditional statements to classify temperatures into different categories. We’ll create a program that takes a temperature input from the user and provides a classification based on the temperature range. This exercise will help you understand how to use if-elif-else statements, handle user input, and implement a simple loop for program repetition.\n\n# Use if-elif-else statements to classify the temperature\n# Below 0: \"Freezing\"\n# 0-10: \"Cold\"\n# 11-20: \"Cool\"\n# 21-30: \"Warm\"\n# Above 30: \"Hot\"\n\n# a) TODO: Formulate a small programm that asks the user for a temperature and then prints the corresponding classification.\n# Your code here\n\n# b) TODO: Test your code with -5, 15 and 35 as temperature\n# Hint: You dont't need any new code here, just run the code from the previous step with different inputs.\n\n# c) TODO: Add a feature that asks the user if they want to continue and then repeats the programm if they type \"yes\". \n# If the user does not want to continue, the programm should end.\n# Your code here\n\n\n\nNumber guessing game\nIn this exercise, we’ll create an interactive number guessing game for two players. This game will help you practice using loops, conditional statements, and user input handling. You’ll also learn how to implement a simple game logic and manage player turns. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of control structures and basic development concepts in Python.\n\n# Create a number guessing game with 2 players. The first player is the game master and the second player is the guesser. \n# Start by asking for their names. Then, ask the game master to input the secret number between 1 and 20. \n# Make sure, that the number is not shown by adding at least 25 new lines after the input prompt. Then, ask the player to guess the number. \n# If the guess is too high or too low, provide feedback in order to help the player and let the player guess again. \n# If the guess is correct, congratulate the player and end the game.\n\n# a) TODO: Your task list in more detail:\n# - Ask for the names of the game master and the player\n# - Implement the main game loop using a while loop\n# - Ask the game master for the secret number from 1-20\n# - Hint: Use `print(\"\\n\" * 25)` to add 25 new lines\n# - Ask the player for a guess\n# - Compare the guess to the secret number\n# - Provide feedback (too high, too low, or correct)\n# - Keep track of the number of guesses\n# - End the game when the correct number is guessed\n# - Print a congratulatory message with the number of guesses taken\n# - Use the given structure below to implement the game.\n\n# Ask for the names of the game master and the player\ngame_master = input(\"Enter the name of the game master: \")\nplayer = input(\"Enter the name of the player: \")\n\n# Ask the game master for the secret number\nwhile True:\n    secret_number = int(input(f\"{game_master}, enter the secret number between 1 and 20: \"))\n    if secret_number &lt; 1 or secret_number &gt; 20:\n        print(\"Please enter a valid number.\")\n    else:\n        break\n    \nprint(\"\\n\" * 25)  # Add 25 new lines to hide the secret number\n\n# Initialize variables\nguesses = 0\ncorrect = False\n\n# Main game loop\nwhile not correct:\n    # Ask the player for a guess\n    # Add the code here to ask the player for a guess\n    guesses += 1\n    \n    # Compare the guess to the secret number\n    # Add code here to compare the guess to the secret number\n    # If the guess is correct, set correct to True in order to end the game.\n    \n# Print congratulatory message\n# Add the code here to print a congratulatory message.\n\n# b) TODO: Add a feature to allow both players to play again, this time switching the roles with the game master. \n# If the player wants to play again, the game should reset and the player should be able to play again, entering a new secret number to guess for the former game master. \n# If the player does not want to play again, the game should end. Hint: Make sure to inform the players about the new game master using their stated names.\n# Your code here\n\n# c) TODO: Bonus Task - Enhance the game by adding difficulty levels\n# Implement three difficulty levels: Easy (1-10), Medium (1-20), and Hard (1-30)\n# Ask the game master to choose a difficulty level before entering the secret number\n# Adjust the range of possible numbers based on the chosen difficulty\n# Provide a different number of allowed guesses for each difficulty level:\n#   - Easy: 5 guesses\n#   - Medium: 10 guesses\n#   - Hard: 15 guesses\n# If the player doesn't guess the number within the allowed guesses, end the game and reveal the secret number\n# Your code here\n\n\n\nThat’s it!\nYou can find the solutions to these exercises online in the associated GitHub repository, but we will also quickly go over them in next week’s tutorial.

You should only accept the username if it is valid.\n\n# TODO: Write a function that asks the user for a username and then checks if the username is valid.\n# - A valid username is considered to be a number that is at least 5 characters long and contains no spaces.\n# - If the username is not valid, you should raise an exception, tell the user that the username is not valid and ask for a new username.\n# - You should only accept the username if it is valid.\n\n# You can start by changing the code from the lecture:\nclass InvalidUsernameError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef get_valid_username():\n    while True:\n        try:\n            username = input(\"Please enter a username (no spaces): \")\n            if \" \" in username: \n                raise InvalidUsernameError(\"Username must not contain spaces.\")\n            return username\n        except InvalidUsernameError as e:\n            print(f\"Invalid username: {e}\")\n            print(\"Please try again.\")\n\n\n\nUsing Assertions\nBy using assertions, we can check if the input of a function is correct. If the assertion is not correct, an AssertionError is raised. This is especially useful in the development phase to catch errors that should not occur.\n\n# TODO: Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. Ensure that the length and width are positive numbers.\ndef calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):\n    # Your code here\n    pass\n\n# Test cases\nprint(calculate_rectangle_area(5, 3))    # Should print: 15\nprint(calculate_rectangle_area(-5, 3))   # Should raise AssertionError\nprint(calculate_rectangle_area(5, \"3\"))  # Should raise AssertionError\n\n\n\nDebugging\nIn the following exercise, you’ll have to debug a function that is supposed to return the sum of all even numbers in a list. However, there is a bug in the code. Can you find it and fix it? Use either print statements, assertions, or an IDE’s debugger to fix the code.\n\n# TODO: Fix the bug in the following function.\ndef sum_even_numbers(numbers):\n    total = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            total + num\n    return total\n\n# Test case\nprint(sum_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Should print: 12, but it's not working correctly\n\n# Bonus challenge: Add error handling to make this function more robust\n\n\n\nThat’s it!\nYou can find the solutions to these exercises online in the associated GitHub repository, but we will also quickly go over them in next week’s tutorial.
