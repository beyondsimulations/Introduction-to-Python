# Simulation of a random walk for stock prices
In this excercise, you will create a program that is able to simulate a random walk for stock prices. The program should ask the user for the initial stock price, the number of days to simulate and the daily standard deviation of the stock price. Then, the program should simulate the random walk and visualize the stock price over time. Use the `numpy` library to generate random numbers and the `matplotlib` library to visualize the stock price over time.  

```{python}
# Simulation of a random walk
# TODO: Create a program that is able to simulate a random walk.
# Your code here
```
