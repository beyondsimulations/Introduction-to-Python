# Introduction to Python

This repository contains course materials for a "Programming with Python" course first teached at KÃ¼hne Logistics University Hamburg in Fall 2024. Most of it is written with Quarto and the corresponding website is hosted as Github page.

## Quick Overview

This module introduces programming with Python over the course of 13 weeks. It is aimed at beginners with no prior programming experience. The course is based on many examples that illustrate how to tackle potentially complex issues and implement solutions.

### Course Structure

The course is structured into three main parts:

1. **Part I: Introduction to Programming with Python**
   - Basic concepts, syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and object classes

2. **Part II: Data Science with Python**
