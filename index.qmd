# Objectives
This module introduces **programming with python**. Python is a modern and powerful programming language that is widely used in industry and academic projects. Students will learn how to find a code-based solution to basic and complex problems. The course is based on many examples that illustrate how to tackle a potentially complex issue as well as how to implement a solution.

# Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, students …

- can implement solutions to complex problems in python
- know basic concepts of programming and algorithms such as loops, functions, object classes
- can apply basic data manipulation and visualization
- will be able to read and write code
- will acquire experience in working with core python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- will know how to collaborate in a small team to find solutions for different problems at hand

Please note that this course is **specifically designed for business students**. That is, it is **not required to have any prior knowledge or experience in programming** to attend this course. The teaching format will make it possible to account for different levels of programming skills such that every student can take the most out of the course.

# Course Structure
The course is based on a hands-on approach with a two-fold structure:

1. **Lectures**: In the lectures, we will introduce concepts and illustrate them in reproducible examples.
2. **Hands-on Tutorials**: Students will practically apply the concepts of the lecture in hands-on examples.

# Course Blocks
The core content of the course is organized in three blocks:

## Part I: 
**Introduction to Programming with Python (Week 1–5)**\
In the first part, an introduction to the basic concepts of programming in Python is provided. Students will learn the Python syntax, data types, as well as how to implement loops, functions, and object classes in Python. We will introduce core Python libraries, too, including NumPy and Pandas. Once these concepts are understood, we will learn how they can be used to solve problems.

## Part II: 
**Data Science with Python (Week 6-8)**\
In the second part, we will cover basic data science tools in Python referring to data manipulation, descriptive and explorative analysis as well as visualization. At the end, an outlook will be provided on the next steps in Python, including statistical analysis and machine learning.

## Part III:
**Programming Projects (Week 9-13)**\
In the third part, students will be assigned mini projects in Python where they can apply their new knowledge in groups on a project of their choice. Each group will present their results and get feedback at the end of the semester.
