# Objectives
This module introduces **programming with python**. Python is a modern and powerful programming language that is widely used in industry and academic projects. Students will learn how to find a code-based solution to basic and complex problems. The course is based on many examples that illustrate how to tackle a potentially complex issue as well as how to implement a solution.

# Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the course, students â€¦

- can implement solutions to complex problems in python
- know basic concepts of programming and algorithms such as loops, functions
- can apply basic data manipulation and visualization
- will be able to read and write code
- will have experience working with python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- will know how to collaborate in a small team to find solutions for problems at hand

Please note that this course is **specifically designed for business students**. That is, it is **not required to have any prior knowledge or experience in programming** to attend this course. The teaching format will make it possible to account for different levels of programming skills such that every student can take the most out of the course.

# Course Structure
The course is based on a hands-on approach with a two-fold structure:

1. **Lectures**: In the lectures, we will introduce concepts and illustrate them in reproducible examples.
2. **Hands-on Tutorials**: Students will practically apply the concepts of the lecture in hands-on examples.
3. **Assignments**: Students will solve programming exercises in groups of up to three students that they will have to hand in.

# Course Blocks
The core content of the course is organized in three blocks:

1. **Part I**: Introduction to Programming with Python
2. **Part II**: Data Science with Python
3. **Part III**: Programming Projects

You can find more information on the course blocks and the corresponding lectures in the [syllabus](syllabus.qmd).

# Passing the Course

- 75% attendance required for passing the course
- You will be given two programming assignments and one project to solve with Python
- You can group up (3 students) and work together
- Each student group submits one solution together
